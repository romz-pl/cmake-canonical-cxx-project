# The canonical C++ project based on cmake

In this project I present how the [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/) project can be organized when [CMake](https://cmake.org/) package is used.

## From CMake web page

CMake is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, 
test and package software. CMake is used to control the software 
compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration 
files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler 
environment of your choice. The suite of CMake tools were created by Kitware 
in response to the need for a powerful, cross-platform build environment for 
open-source projects such as ITK and VTK.

CMake is part of [Kitware’s](https://www.kitware.com/) collection of commercially supported open-source platforms for software development.
