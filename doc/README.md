# The canonical C++ project based on cmake

In this project I present how the C++ project can be organized when CMake package is used.

The Graphviz file generated by the command
```
cmake -S ./cmake-canonical-cxx-project -B ./build-dir --graphviz=./build-dir/canonical.dot
```
is presented on the [figure](./graphviz.org)
